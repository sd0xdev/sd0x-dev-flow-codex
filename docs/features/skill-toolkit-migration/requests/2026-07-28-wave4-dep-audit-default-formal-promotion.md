## Background

The canonical `dep-audit/default` payload completed the legacy repository-only `quality-pack` handoff. This replacement owner promotes those audited bytes into the distributable plugin without rewriting historical evidence.

## Requirements

- Preserve the accepted behavior and routing boundary for `dep-audit/default`.
- Rebind the candidate contract and routing evidence to the formal plugin package.
- Keep the prior pack-ready payload, request, and evidence immutable.

## Scope

| Scope | Description |
|---|---|
| In | Upgrade and promote only `dep-audit/default` into the distributable plugin. |
| Out | Other promotion units、external service authentication、compatibility alias entrypoints |

## Related Files

| File | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `migration/packs/quality-pack/dep-audit/` | Read | Immutable accepted predecessor payload |
| `migration/candidates/dep-audit/` | New | Formal plugin candidate revision |
| `plugin/sd0x-dev-flow-codex/skills/dep-audit/` | New | Distributable canonical target |
| `test/dep-audit-default-routing.test.js` | Update | Formal-package routing and semantic contracts |
| `migration/source-disposition.json` | Update | Current package、owner and delivery transition |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Candidate bytes preserve the complete accepted workflow and meaningful failure boundaries.
- [x] Contract binds all assigned source names to one canonical promotion unit.
- [x] Legacy pack payload, Completed request, and durable pack-ready evidence remain unchanged.
- [x] Routing and semantic tests bind the formal plugin package and canonical owner.
- [x] Candidate preflight binds exact payload, disposition, and trusted test identity.
- [x] Final plugin destination matches the accepted candidate bytes.
- [x] R3 closure inputs identify this exact request, promotion unit, evidence kind, and final-fingerprint fields.

## Progress

| Phase | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Analysis | Complete | The immutable pack-ready predecessor and current canonical owner were resolved. |
| Development | Complete | Formal-plugin candidate payload `22a098439764ea7221932671ec8967eb4ccd94dfeb079356610c26a11f33acf6` preserves the accepted predecessor behavior and package boundary. |
| Testing | Complete | Routing, semantic, and static checks passed. Preflight `7bea2493e04a780afe74ce7ad5b8ff05f9d69557a679584f54904689b5dab85c`. Final audit `ec37c04e89f785cb6d2bfe8906318d27ced7075b7907238d1f62017557836a62` passed. |
| Acceptance | Complete | Runtime-owned R3 closure and promotion evidence bind this Completed owner. |
