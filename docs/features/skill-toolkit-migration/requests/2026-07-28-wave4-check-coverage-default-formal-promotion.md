## Background

The canonical `check-coverage/default` payload completed the legacy repository-only `quality-pack` handoff. This replacement owner promotes those audited bytes into the distributable plugin without rewriting historical evidence.

## Requirements

- Preserve the accepted behavior and routing boundary for `check-coverage/default`.
- Rebind the candidate contract and routing evidence to the formal plugin package.
- Keep the prior pack-ready payload, request, and evidence immutable.

## Scope

| Scope | Description |
|---|---|
| In | Upgrade and promote only `check-coverage/default` into the distributable plugin. |
| Out | Other promotion units、external service authentication、compatibility alias entrypoints |

## Related Files

| File | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `migration/packs/quality-pack/check-coverage/` | Read | Immutable accepted predecessor payload |
| `migration/candidates/check-coverage/` | New | Formal plugin candidate revision |
| `plugin/sd0x-dev-flow-codex/skills/check-coverage/` | New | Distributable canonical target |
| `test/check-coverage-default-routing.test.js` | Update | Formal-package routing and semantic contracts |
| `migration/source-disposition.json` | Update | Current package、owner and delivery transition |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Candidate bytes preserve the complete accepted workflow and meaningful failure boundaries.
- [x] Contract binds all assigned source names to one canonical promotion unit.
- [x] Legacy pack payload, Completed request, and durable pack-ready evidence remain unchanged.
- [x] Routing and semantic tests bind the formal plugin package and canonical owner.
- [x] Candidate preflight binds exact payload, disposition, and trusted test identity.
- [x] Final plugin destination matches the accepted candidate bytes.
- [x] R3 closure inputs identify this exact request, promotion unit, evidence kind, and final-fingerprint fields.

## Progress

| Phase | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Analysis | Complete | The immutable pack-ready predecessor and current canonical owner were resolved. |
| Development | Complete | Formal-plugin candidate payload `871415d76f81ec494300d575fcd1914ce436557faefdbb1cac39020d3e6b278f` preserves the accepted predecessor behavior and package boundary. |
| Testing | Complete | Routing, semantic, and static checks passed. Preflight `f0c411332c291e3c983d4ae67f64be49bca82a6b01bc9a2fed22014eb8b7d6c2`. Final audit `df3363a60272584f870f22fe784ba08c24559c1d5fecd9ff27e439d84ff2d89a` passed. |
| Acceptance | Complete | Runtime-owned R3 closure and promotion evidence bind this Completed owner. |
