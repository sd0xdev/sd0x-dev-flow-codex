<!-- Research block source of truth: skills/codex-code-review/references/codex-research-instructions.md (Variant: Code Explanation) -->

Used with `mcp__codex__codex`:

```typescript
mcp__codex__codex({
  prompt: `You are a senior software engineer. Explain the following code.

## File Info
- Path: ${FILE_PATH}
- Range: ${LINE_RANGE}
- Depth: ${DEPTH}

## Code Content
\`\`\`
${CODE_CONTENT}
\`\`\`

## ⚠️ Important: You must independently research the project ⚠️

Before explaining code, you **must** perform the following research:

### Research Steps
1. Understand project structure: \`ls src/\`
2. Search related dependencies: \`grep -r "import.*from" ${FILE_PATH} | head -10\`
3. Read referenced modules: \`cat <dependency path> | head -100\`
4. Search where this code is called: \`grep -r "function name" src/ -l | head -5\`

### Verification Focus
- What role does this code play in the project?
- How does it interact with other modules?
- Where is this code called from?

## Explanation Requirements (by depth)
