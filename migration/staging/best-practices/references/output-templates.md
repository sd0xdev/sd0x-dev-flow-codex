## Phase 4: Gap Report

```markdown
## Best Practices Audit Report

**Topic**: [technology] best practices alignment
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Debate threadId**: <threadId from Phase 3>
**Verdict**: OK (largely compliant) / WARN (room for improvement) / FAIL (major deviation)

### Phase 3 Evidence (mandatory — proves debate was executed)

- **Debate command**: /codex-brainstorm
- **Debate threadId**: <threadId from Phase 3 session>
- **Debate rounds**: <N rounds or "equilibrium at round N">

### Debate Conclusion (mandatory — references Phase 3 equilibrium)

- Equilibrium / consensus / divergence (cite specific rounds and arguments from Phase 3)
- Claude's position: ...
- Codex's position: ...
- Equilibrium state: Nash equilibrium / convergence / divergence

### Gap Analysis

| #   | Best Practice | Current State | Gap  | Priority | Recommended Action |
| --- | ------------- | ------------- | ---- | -------- | ------------------ |
| 1   | ...           | ...           | ...  | P1       | ...                |

### Recommended Roadmap

| Priority | Action Item      | Impact Scope | Estimated Effort |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| P1       | Must fix         | ...          | S/M/L            |
| P2       | Should improve   | ...          | S/M/L            |
| P3       | Nice-to-have     | ...          | S/M/L            |
