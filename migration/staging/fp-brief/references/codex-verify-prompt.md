# Codex Verification Prompt Template

Used when `--verify codex` is specified. Dispatched via `mcp__codex__codex`.

## Mandatory Fields (per codex-invocation.md)

| Check | Required |
|-------|----------|
| Prompt includes "independently research" section | Yes |
| Prompt includes concrete git/grep/cat commands | Yes |
| Prompt does NOT contain Claude's analysis/conclusions | Yes |
| `sandbox: 'read-only'` | Yes |
| `approval-policy: 'never'` | Yes |

## Template

```typescript
mcp__codex__codex({
  prompt: `You are a senior reasoning auditor. Your task is to independently verify
a first-principles briefing against its source document.

## Files to Review
- Source document: ${SOURCE_PATH}
- FP-Brief output: ${OUTPUT_PATH}

## ⚠️ Important: You must independently research the project ⚠️

### Git Exploration (Priority)
1. Check change status: \`git status\`
2. Check changed files: \`git diff --name-only HEAD\`
3. Check full changes for source: \`git diff HEAD -- ${SOURCE_PATH}\`

### Document Reading (Required)
4. Read source document: \`cat ${SOURCE_PATH}\`
5. Read FP-Brief output: \`cat ${OUTPUT_PATH}\`

### Project Research
6. Search for modules referenced in the briefing: \`grep -r "keyword" skills/ -l | head -10\`
7. Verify referenced files exist: \`ls <path>\`
8. Read related files for context: \`cat <file-path> | head -100\`

## Verification Dimensions

For each dimension, assess independently — do NOT rely on the briefing's own claims.

### 1. Root Problem Depth
- Does the 5-Why decomposition reach an irreducible truth?
- Or does it stop at a surface-level restatement?

### 2. Assumption Completeness
- Are there assumptions in the source doc NOT captured in the register?
- Look for: implicit constraints, technology assumptions, scope boundaries

### 3. Reasoning Chain Integrity
- Are there logical jumps? (decision without a traced principle)
- Does each decision actually follow from its stated principle?

### 4. Decision Sensitivity Accuracy
- Are there missing assumption→decision links?
- Are impact ratings reasonable?

### 5. Coverage Completeness
- Are there important source sections not reflected in the briefing?
- Are there decisions in the source doc not captured in the reasoning chain?

## Output Format

Produce a Verification Delta table:

| Aspect | Claude Assessment | Codex Assessment | Delta |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| Root Problem depth | <adequate/shallow> | <your assessment> | <agree/disagree + detail> |
| Missing assumptions | <count or "none"> | <your findings> | <new assumptions found> |
| Reasoning gaps | <count or "none"> | <your findings> | <logical jumps identified> |
| Sensitivity completeness | <complete/partial> | <your assessment> | <missing links> |
| Coverage | <complete/partial> | <your assessment> | <uncovered sections> |

End with a one-line summary: "Verification: CONFIRMED / GAPS_FOUND / NEEDS_REVISION"`,
  sandbox: 'read-only',
  'approval-policy': 'never',
});
```
