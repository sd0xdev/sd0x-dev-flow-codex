# Codex Prompt: AC Traceability Verification

<!-- Research block source of truth: skills/codex-code-review/references/codex-research-instructions.md (Variant: Test Review) -->

## Verification Prompt

**Initial verification**: Use `mcp__codex__codex` (fresh thread — never reuse a code review session thread).
**Re-verification after gap closure**: Use `mcp__codex__codex-reply` with the AC trace threadId (see Continue Review Prompt below).

```typescript
mcp__codex__codex({
  prompt: `You are a senior test engineer performing AC-to-evidence traceability verification.

## Request Document
- Path: ${REQUEST_PATH}
- Total ACs: ${TOTAL_AC_COUNT} (${NON_QG_COUNT} non-quality-gate)

## Acceptance Criteria (non-quality-gate only)
${AC_LIST}

## Related Test Files
${TEST_FILE_LIST}

## ⚠️ Important: You must independently research the project ⚠️

When verifying AC-to-evidence traceability, you **must** perform the following research:

### Research Steps
1. Read the request document: \`cat ${REQUEST_PATH}\`
2. Check project test structure: \`ls test/\`, \`ls test/unit/\`, \`ls test/integration/\`
3. For each AC, search for matching test assertions: \`grep -r "relevant keyword" test/ -l | head -10\`
4. Read candidate test files: \`cat <test path> | head -150\`
5. Check for runtime verification results: \`grep -r "feature-verify" docs/ -l | head -5\`
6. Search for exception annotations in the request doc: \`grep -i "exception" ${REQUEST_PATH}\`

### Verification Focus
- Does each AC have at least one matching test assertion?
- Are test assertions covering the AC behavior, not just a function name?
- For manual exceptions: is the reason class valid? Is the expiry future?
- For prohibited domains (Security, Data-integrity, Regression): exceptions are NEVER valid

## Output (all fields required, one entry per non-quality-gate AC)

For each AC:
- ac_number: <N>
- ac_text: <text>
- evidence_type: automated_test | runtime_verification | manual_exception | none
- evidence_location: <file:line or description>
- confidence: High | Medium | Low
- status: COVERED | EXCEPTION_VALID | EXCEPTION_INVALID | UNCOVERED | INCONCLUSIVE
- reasoning: <why this status — cite specific test file/line or exception details>

For each manual exception:
- exception_verdict: VALID_EXCEPTION | INVALID_EXCEPTION
- reason_class: <ENV_UNAVAILABLE | UNSAFE_TO_AUTOMATE | ONE_TIME_MIGRATION | INVALID>
- expiry: <ISO 8601 date or MISSING>
- domain_check: <ALLOWED | PROHIBITED>

Final summary:
- gate: Adequate | Adequate_with_exceptions | Need_Human | Inadequate
- gaps: [list of uncovered AC numbers]
- exception_count: <N> / <cap>`,
  sandbox: 'read-only',
  'approval-policy': 'never',
});
```

## Anti-Anchoring Enforcement

Per `@rules/codex-invocation.md`:

| Check | Required |
|-------|----------|
| Prompt does NOT contain Claude's evidence mapping conclusions | ✅ |
| Prompt does NOT ask "is this mapping correct?" | ✅ |
| Prompt includes "independently research" section | ✅ |
| Initial verification uses fresh `mcp__codex__codex`; re-verification uses `codex-reply` | ✅ |
| `sandbox: 'read-only'` set | ✅ |
| `approval-policy: 'never'` set | ✅ |

## AC List Formatting

Provide only the raw AC text with checkbox state. Do NOT include Claude's evidence analysis:

```
1. [ ] User login returns JWT
2. [x] Rate limit at 100 req/min
3. [ ] XSS sanitization
```

## Continue Review Prompt

Used with `mcp__codex__codex-reply` when re-verifying after gap closure:

```typescript
mcp__codex__codex-reply({
  threadId: THREAD_ID,
  prompt: `ACs were updated. Please re-verify evidence traceability.

## Updated AC List
${UPDATED_AC_LIST}

## Changes Since Last Review
${DIFF_SUMMARY}

Check: Did gap closure introduce new evidence? Did fixes introduce new issues?

Re-output the full AC traceability matrix and updated gate.`,
});
```
