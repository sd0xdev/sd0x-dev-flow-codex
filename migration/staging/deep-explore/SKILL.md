# Deep Explore Skill

## Trigger

- Keywords: deep explore, large-scale research, multi-agent explore, codebase survey, parallel investigation, comprehensive research, deep dive multiple areas

## When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Alternative |
|----------|------------|
| Quick single-area lookup | `/code-explore` |
| Dual Claude+Codex confirmation | `/code-investigate` |
| Git history tracking | `/git-investigate` |
| Code review | `/codex-review-fast` |

## Workflow Overview

    G -->|score >= 80 + no critical Qs| H[Report]
    G -->|score < 80 OR critical Qs| I[Wave 3: Cross-cutting]
    I --> H
```

## Phase 0: Intent Analysis

1. Parse user's research question
2. Estimate scope: `Grep` for related keywords → count unique files
3. Routing guard: if estimated files <= 25, redirect to `/code-explore`
4. Plan shards: identify 2-3 non-overlapping exploration areas

### Shard Planning Strategy

| Priority | Method | When |
|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | User-specified areas (`--areas`) | User knows what to split |
| 2 | Domain-based clustering | Auto-detect service/provider/hooks/rules boundaries |
| 3 | Directory-based fallback | When domain boundaries unclear |

Output: ownership matrix (shard → files).

## Wave 1: Breadth (Mandatory)

Fan-out 2-3 Explore agents in parallel. Each agent explores one shard.

```
Agent({
  description: "Wave 1 Shard A: <area description>",
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: <agent-prompt template from references/agent-prompt.md>
});
```

All agents dispatched in a **single message** (parallel). Wait for all to complete.

### Agent Contract (80/20)

| Allocation | Scope | Limit |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 80% | Primary assigned shard | Unlimited findings |
| 20% | Peripheral vision (security, edge cases, cross-cutting) | Max 2 peripheral findings |

Peripheral findings must be evidence-backed (file:line) and tagged: `cross-cutting | security | reliability | operability`.

## Inter-Wave: Gather + Plan

After each wave, the orchestrator:

1. **Collect** all agent results
2. **Build claim registry** (see `references/synthesis.md`)
3. **Rank open questions** by `impact × uncertainty`
4. **Build context packet** for next wave

### Context Packet (what to pass forward)

| Pass | Don't Pass |
|------|-----------|
| Evidence-backed facts (file:line) | Prior wave conclusions as truth |
| Open Qs ranked by impact × uncertainty | Narrative interpretations |
| Do-not-repeat ledger (explored files, executed queries) | Full raw findings dump |
| Contradiction list | Agent opinions without evidence |

## Wave 2: Depth (Mandatory)

Focus on top hotspots from Wave 1, ranked by `impact × uncertainty × blast_radius`.

- 2-3 agents, each assigned one hotspot for deep dive
- Context packet from Wave 1 provided (facts + questions, not conclusions)
- Agents verify Wave 1 hypotheses independently

## Completeness Gate

After Wave 2 (and Wave 3 if run), compute completeness score.

### 2-Signal Completeness Score

```
score = round(100 × (0.7 × (1 - novelty_rate) + 0.3 × is_zero(critical_open)))

Where:
  novelty_rate = unique_new_findings / max(1, total_valid_findings)
  critical_open = count(questions where impact=high AND uncertainty=high)
  is_zero(x) = 1 if x == 0, else 0
```

Zero findings → `novelty_rate = 0` → `score = 70` (below threshold → continue).

### Stop Conditions

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `score >= 80` AND `critical_open == 0` | Stop, output report |
| `score >= 80` AND `critical_open > 0` | Wave 3 (if not yet run) |
| Wave 3 done AND `score < 80` | Stop with `Inconclusive` + next actions |

### Hard-Fail Overrides (force continue)

- Unanswered critical user question
- High-severity contradiction unresolved
- Evidence missing for high-impact claim

### Precedence (`--waves` is hard ceiling)

| User `--waves` | Hard-fail active | Behavior |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| `--waves 2` | No | Stop after Wave 2 |
| `--waves 2` | Yes | Stop after Wave 2 with `Inconclusive` |
| `--waves 3` | No | Adaptive (stop early if score met) |
| `--waves 3` | Yes | Force Wave 3 |

User `--waves` never exceeded. Hard-fail emits `Inconclusive` with explanation.

## Wave 3: Cross-cutting (Optional)

Triggered only when:
- Unresolved critical open questions are cross-cutting, OR
- Findings >70% concentrated in 1 subsystem, OR
- High-risk domain flags (auth/security/migration)

If no trigger conditions met, skip Wave 3 even if `score < 80`.

Agents in Wave 3 follow 80/20 contract. If trigger is cross-cutting, one agent may operate as conditional scout with broader mandate.

## Agent Dispatch Contract

```typescript
// Primary: Agent tool with subagent_type=Explore
Agent({
  description: "Wave N Shard X: <description>",
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: `<from references/agent-prompt.md>`
});
```

**Fallback** (if Explore dispatch fails):
1. Retry with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
2. If still fails → degrade to single-agent inline exploration
3. Mark coverage gap in report

## Claim Registry (Synthesis)

See `references/synthesis.md` for full algorithm.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1. Normalize | `{claim, evidence(file:line), shard, wave, confidence}` |
| 2. Dedup | Key = `canonical_file_path + canonical_claim_text` (±5 line tolerance) |
| 3. Consensus | Same claim from 2+ shards → `[consensus]` |
| 4. Conflict | Contradicting claims → evidence-weight resolution |
| 5. Divergence | Unresolvable → explicit divergence section |

Evidence redaction: follow `@rules/logging.md` — no secrets, file:line refs only.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `<query>` | Research topic/question | Required |
| `--agents N` | Agents per wave (1-3) | 3 |
| `--waves N` | Max waves (2-3) | 3 (adaptive) |
| `--areas "a, b, c"` | Manual shard specification | Auto-detect |
| `--quick` | Redirect to `/code-explore` | Off |
