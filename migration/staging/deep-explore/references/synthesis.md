# Synthesis Algorithm & Report Template

## Claim Registry Algorithm

After each wave, the orchestrator builds/updates the claim registry:

### Step 1: Normalize

Each agent finding → structured entry:

```
{
  claim: "Hook state file uses mkdir-based locking for POSIX atomicity",
  evidence: "hooks/post-tool-review-state.sh:44",
  shard: "hooks",
  wave: 1,
  confidence: "High"
}
```

### Step 2: Dedup

Key = `canonical_file_path + canonical_claim_text`
- Line tolerance: ±5 lines (same file, similar claim = duplicate)
- Conflict resolution: keep highest confidence
- Source merge: same key from 2+ agents → `source = "consensus"`

### Step 3: Consensus Detection

Claims appearing from 2+ independent shards are marked `[consensus]` — higher reliability.

### Step 4: Conflict Resolution

When agents produce contradicting claims about the same area:

| Evidence Weight | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| High | Direct file:line reference + code quote |
| Medium | Indirect inference from related code |
| Low | Assumption without direct evidence |

Higher evidence weight wins. If tied → mark as `[divergence]`.

### Step 5: Divergence Section

Unresolvable contradictions go to explicit divergence section with both claims, evidence, and suggested resolution approach.

## Completeness Score Display

```markdown
### Completeness: <score>/100

| Signal | Value | Weight |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Novelty rate | <N>% (Wave <W>) | 70% |
| Critical open Qs | <N> remaining | 30% |

Confidence cap: <1.0 | 0.9 | 0.75> (<reason>)
```

### Confidence Cap Table

| Condition | Cap | Reason |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| All waves + agents successful | 1.0 | Full evidence |
| 1 agent failed/timed out | 0.9 | Partial coverage gap |
| 2+ agents failed or major evidence gap | 0.75 | Significant degradation |
